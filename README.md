# Using Plotly to Create Interactive Visualizations:
### In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard exploring a dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The interactive dashboard allows you to select a Subject ID and will update the information and visualizations to display the data for that given subject.

#### Visualizations:
1. Bar graph: The displayed bar graph visualizes the top 10 occuring operational taxonomic units (AKA: OTUs) including the OTU ID and the sample value. If you hover over each bar, it will list the labels (names) of the microbial species.
2. Gauge: The gauge monitor displays the amount per week which the subject washed their navel.
3. Bubble Chart: The bubble chart displays all of the microbe samples observed for the subject.
